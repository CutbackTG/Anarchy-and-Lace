# User Stories
1. New User — Browsing the Collection

As a first-time visitor,
I want to browse the boutique’s products and featured fabrics without creating an account,
so that I can explore the aesthetic, materials, and pricing before deciding whether to engage further.

2. Interested Customer — Creating an Account

As an interested customer,
I want to create an account using my email address,
so that I can save my details, and return easily in the future.


3. Returning Customer — Shopping

As a returning customer,
I want to log in and access my saved shopping cart,
so that I can continue shopping without losing items I previously selected.


4. Boutique Owner / Manager — Managing Products

As a boutique manager,
I want to create, edit, and manage products through a secure manager interface,
so that I can update stock, pricing, and product details without modifying code.

5. Design-Focused Customer — Exploring Materials & commission work

As a design-conscious customer,
I want to explore the history of kimono fabrics,
so that I can appreciate the materials and craftsmanship behind the garments before asking about some commission work.
